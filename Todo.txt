Nodes:
for loop - done
save to file - done
readfile - done
prompt with context and sys prompt - done
wiring  - done
add prompt table and nice way to add edit prompts - done


context - to do
File context
sql context
dataset context

Datasets
    will have data sets.


Experiments
    - Basically experiment will be created from plan and can be run from an particualr node.
    - each run of experiment generate an output that can will be saved in the database and analyzed later.


priority:
    on double click open to edit
    test prompt and prompt template

add personas to prompt

10/13
cut
patch
normal to surface
divide polygon at z n levels
divide polygon in nm parts on axis a,b
generate points by equation
design script
action sequnce
design sequence
universe describe
decision diagram
grill design
bridge designer


test everything
add support for patch
add support for parameter component type
parameter will be derived form parent component type called parameter
and we can define as many parameters as we want to.

add supoport
 for randomizing points within a bounding box
 offset polygon
 circumscribed polygon
 convex hull
 boundry rectangle

 pixalate
 path to points
 bezier curve from points
 points on bezier curve
 add point between two point indexa
maximum inscribed circle
random points around in radius"?
scale points
scalew polygon


done -- add support for curves so we can add curves ands ave curves
done -- we need to add ui for curve design
done -- add button to start stop point editing, points line etc should be able to be mvoed around
done -- add support for multi curve so when we go to curve editor we can add a multiline curve with all ponts on the curve movable
done -- scalex scaley should be input on point editor
done -- and we can click a point to say it is control point and control points are to be shown dark green

done - tangent to curve is - create plane on curve create line straight form left to right throuigh origin then find line perpendicular to it through origin.
done - add tangent plane at distance (x, tollerance) from point on curve
done - add plane at tangent to surface or curve
done for what we need - add support for advanced features for sweep, extrude, loft etc.

draw multi curve support

points will have a lot of properties such as force field, force vector, control point, amount of randomness etc.
There will be regions for force field randomness etc.
add attractors, forces, force fields, random ness
we will add support for curve in ui and from there we can find points on curve
add randomizer boxes and circles and regions so when giving to a generator it will randomize
We need to create a world creator - start with rock and mountain creator
we need to add distructuro so distructors will be bursh.
a brush is defined as a path and a curve that define stroke - this will create solid brush
a brush path is defined as a path where the bursh body will move
need to add support for distructors so distructs are basically distructor brushes created as solids
add suport for decal and add support for distrcution points and curves so distructions are applied to those points
add support for creating skeltons skeltons are basically path combinations that define how the object looks
we will also define point called as action point at action point some work or exansion is done
so we can define a line and on line can add action point which define a curve or polygon perpendicular to path and can be used to generate objects
we need to deine maker factories for rocks pillars etc.
use colors for depth and impact and forces
add a property editor so when we click on object we can open properties for it.
we need to add a point editor that defines flow for that point

add support for getting curve and lines from fusion 360
create dedicated leaft editor
add support for relief brush a relief brush will iterate over a path and then do something



done -- add ability to mark the points and save markers markers will be tags
done -- so there will be an input field called tag and then when tag button is clikked will addd tag to
done -- the marked point
done -- add ability to filter points in tags
add a component creator node
done -- add a node to save curve
done -- add a node to save points

done - add close curve buttonthat will add a close point int he path
done - tag mark support oin mouse over
done - surface sweep
done - surface features

add support torevolve around any axis

custom code
support pure node
add predicate function
add filter function
add point generate function

condition handler - done
reverse points - done
get points form tangent plane - done
get points from curve - done
get point from curve - done
