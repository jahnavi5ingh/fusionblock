Create a React-based generic table and form component using Material-UI (MUI) with the following specifications:

GenericTable Component:

Accepts a REST endpoint and a structure object to define the fields and their properties.
Displays data fetched from the endpoint in a MUI table.
Supports actions: add, update, and delete records with corresponding icons.
Shows toast notifications for success or failure of fetch, add, update, and delete operations.
Formats date fields as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
" using dayjs.
Displays field names and their data types in the table header.
GenericForm Component:

Used for adding or updating records.
Dynamically generates form fields based on the structure object:
Supports input types: string, int, boolean, date, text, JSON, properties, and choice fields.
Uses DateTimePicker from MUI for date fields.
Uses Ace Editor for text, JSON, and properties fields.
Handles choice fields using MUI's TextField with select.
Supports read-only fields, which are disabled from editing.
Supports field validation (currently only "required").
Prepopulates form fields with a default value if provided.
